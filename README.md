### Feature (1) Create Login
### Feature (2) Login- Data Validation
### Feature (3) Store passwords
### Feature (4) View passwords
### Feature (5) Add passwords - Manually
### Feature (6) Add passwords - Generate password
### Feature (7) Rating password's strength
### Feature (8) Deleting passwords
### Feature (9) Password Report: Last Login

## Implementation plan
### 1. How each feature will be implemented
1. Understand what each feature does & what it looks like
2. What does each feature need (requirements)
3. Build the feature (coding)
4. Test the feature (unit tests)
5. Implement new logic
6. Test the feature (reiterate testing)
7. Production
### 2. Checklist of tasks for each feature (at least 5)
### Feature (1) Create New Login
1. Create menu for user to select a new user
2. Create if statement (User chooses option 1)
3. Create new_user function  
4. Check new_user function requires input from user, opens cvs file, reads it and gives response of successful Login or Login already exist logic.
5. Error handling is used with  the try and exception function to read if file has already been made previously, or the applications need to do so. This prevents the application from crashing unknowingly.
6. Test user input and expected output with function
### Feature (2) Login- Data Validation
1. Create inputs (user_name) & (user_pass)
2. Create opening file and reading existing user list
3. Create If statement within file reading to check user_name and user_pass is matched within the for loop
4. Create if the username isn't found, to print error
5. Handling user input with If, elif statements for main menu items
6. Test user input and expected output with function
### Feature (3) View passwords
1. Create file open to look into user_list cvs
2. Create for loop to print out any data avaliable
3. If no data seen, print (No existing passwords, press 2 to continue)
4. Create parameters to print out information seperated with ","
5. Test user input and expected output with function
### Feature (4) Add passwords - Manually
1. Create while True Loop, with menu
2. If & Elif options for the menu items
3. Create function password_list to create a cvs and print into it
4. In password_list function, create inputs (pwd_name & pwd_pwd) to print
5. With if condition, check length of password and output accordingly
6. Test user input and expected output with function
### Feature (5) Add passwords - Generate password
1. Create username to be stored
2. Generated password is to use random function and string function to form 12 character secure password
3. Create While True loop to ask user for confirmation
4. Within While Loop to have an iF statement to write generated password into another CVS file.
5. Create copy to clipboard function using pyperclip function
6. Test user input and expected output with function
### Feature (6) Store passwords
Similar steps to Feature 4 & 5 included
### Feature (7) Rating password's strength
Similar steps to Feature 4 included
### Feature (8) Deleting passwords
1. Create variables as empty figures
2. Create password_delete function, Create input to double check user intention
3. Create With statement to open file 
4. Create For statement within With to scan all passwords inside
5. Create IF statement within that For statement to print what is not been inputed if matched
6. Create if Not found match to create an error message
7. Test user input and expected output with function
### Feature (9) Password Report: Last Login, Password Count, Password Generated Count
1. Create variable that collects current time and date, using import Datetime
2. Create a line count variable
3. Create a count line function using a For loop to look at the cvs file
4. Error handling created with Try & Except functions to know when a file does not exist
5. Test user input and expected output with function


### 3. Priority: implementation of different features
1. Creating Login accounts
2. Login - Data Validation
3. Adding passwords
4. Storing passwords
5. Viewing passwords
6. Deleting passwords
7. Generating passwords
